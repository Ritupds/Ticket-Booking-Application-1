1. I have created a database model with the help of python flask and sqlalchemy.
2. In the database model I have added Venue, Show, User, Admin, Booking, Rating and Association tables. 
3. I have used python __init__ function to initialize the attributes of the objects.
4. I have created necessary template pages for the front end part.
5. I have used app routing for mapping the URLs to specific functions that will handle the logic for that URL.
6. I have created routes for creating new venues, shows, editing and removing venues and shows.
7. Also Ihave created routes for view the details of those venues and shows.
8. I have created search routes and booking routes.
9. And added functionality to add connect the back-end with the front-end.
